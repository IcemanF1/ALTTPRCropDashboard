# ALTTPRCropDashboard

Made with the intentions of making cropping and setup of a ALTTPR Restream easier.

VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT!  Still a big work in progress!

Currently working decently - Save OBS/Crop settings locally, pull source crop settings from OBS.

Somewhat working but needs lots of work - Sending the crop info to OBS.  If the VLC source remains the same, re-cropping is fine.  It's when the resolution changes drastically from what it was and/or there are black bars to either side.  Math behind this as well as the way the information is sent to OBS is in major need of revamp to make this dynamic and allow one person to set the cropping for others to benefit.

# Notes

I am not a major coder.  Just squeak by with what I need to do at work which is simple compared to what others do.  VB.net is what I use at work so it's what I'm familiar with.
