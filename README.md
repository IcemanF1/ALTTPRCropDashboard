# ALTTPRCropDashboard

Made with the intentions of making cropping and setup of a ALTTPR Restream easier.

VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT!  Still a big work in progress!

Currently working decently:
- Initial setup to save settings
- Save OBS/Crop settings to a local DB file
- Set Commentary/Runner names and tracker URL's to OBS
- Send the VLC video to the proper sources
- Pull source crop settings from OBS
- Set crop from pulled database

Somewhat working but needs work:
- Ability to change the OBS Websocket port to open a 2nd instance without it complaining/crashing
- Open VLC of the stream of the player selected (works but a redesign of what we save to the DB will mean this changes as well)
- Expert mode for features to test and thus not quite ready for widespread use

# Notes

I am not a major coder.  Just squeak by with what I need to do at work which is simple compared to what others do.  VB.net is what I use at work so it's what I'm familiar with.
